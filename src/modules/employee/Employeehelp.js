            <p>1. Recruitment
                Recruitment is one of the most crucial aspects of employee management as it acts as the first step in guiding the employee towards a successful career in the organization. Hence, recruitment must be undertaken with utmost precision with a laser-focused strategy. As it involves multiple tasks from sourcing the right candidates to onboarding the ideal employee, hiring is critical for the successful creation of a well-rounded employer brand.



                Additionally, hiring the right candidates impacts your organizational productivity positively, leading to increased sales and profit. Combined with robust employer branding, you will be setting your organization on an excellent cycle where good talent results in enhanced employer branding, which further attracts better talent towards your organization.



                2. Performance
                Once an employee is hired, you should also monitor their performance to ensure that they work according to the quality and quantity standards set by your organization. Managing employee performance also requires you to set goals for them and track their progress to ensure their accomplishment. To ensure this, employees are armed with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and key Responsibility Areas (KRAs).



                Based on the observations, you can decide whether they should be recognized and rewarded for their achievements or whether to upskill them to improve their performance. Both of these aspects of employee management further enhance employee satisfaction as recognition motivates them to work harder, while upskilling enables them to understand their importance to their organization.



                3. Communication
                Communication is essential for any modern organization as it is comprised of different teams working together towards achieving organizational goals. While managers need to communicate with their staff for allocating work, the organization should also ensure that communication happens both ways. They should also accept the feedback shared by their employees and work on improving their work culture.



                Employees feel included and a ‘part of the family’ only when transparent communication is present in their work environment. Hence, open-door policies, compliant boxes, idea boxes, etc. are essential in the modern workspace. While communication can be complex in a work environment, especially considering the legalities involved, you should strive to remain as transparent with your employees as possible.



                4. Recognition
                Recognition not only motivates your employees to deliver results but also instils the realization of how much you value them. It helps them understand their relevance for their organization and the magnitude of the tasks they undertake daily. This realization helps them strive to be the best in their job, leaving you with loyal and engaged employees.



                Hence, rewards and recognition are critical factors, that ensure the success of employee management strategies. It can be as small as a heartfelt ‘thank you’ or a small felicitation in front of their team; employees will remember the gesture which got them recognized in front of their teammates. Hence, recognition should always be prioritized in your employee management strategies.



                5. Discipline
                Discipline is often overlooked, but still an essential component of effective employee management. Disciplining is required to improve different kinds of issues related to employee performance, attendance, behaviour, etc. It is also required to enforce organizational policies, which help maintain the office decorum and ensure that work is undertaken efficiently.



                Discipline can be implemented in several ways, starting from deploying office policies to undertaking one-on-one meetings with those who default, to firing repeat offenders after an adequate number of premediated warnings. Even legal action can be taken in case of serious offences like fraud, sexual harassment, etc.
